# Class Index

This package requires either an extensive overhaul, or deprecation - i've chosen to deprecate this module since there's already resources out there which would achieve what the overhauled Class Index package would achieve.

Please use the following resource if you're wanting the same level of control when it comes to parsing an API dump.
