Deprecated - there is no simple way to say this, I don't have the resources, time, or understanding to implement a library as vast as this one, my initial idea was to add support for a range of picture formats - I got as far as encoding a PNG, and called it a day.

Sure i'd like to pick this up at some point, but it'd have to be several different projects, a big project of this size isn't feasible for myself.

Since this module provided the ability to encode PNG files, i'll direct you to an alternative, please check out rbx-png;
